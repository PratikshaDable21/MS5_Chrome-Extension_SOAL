## Problem Statement

When Chrome was first released, users praised its speed, but many said they couldn’t switch from Firefox because of the add-ons. Google fixed that in 2009, and the numbers show Chrome gaining users at a much more rapid pace than Firefox is now.  
Can you guess how many extensions are there in Chrome and add-ons in firefox now ?

**Ever wondered How to create a chrome extension ?** Well, this week you are going to build chrome extension which has following features

- **Notes and Annotations**  
   Instead of making notes in external applications, attach notes to websites, and pieces of text in them. All without leaving the browser.
- **Power-Search your History**  
   Instead of bookmarking things, instantly find websites you’ve seen with anything you remember. Search for every word in the text and filter by time, domain, custom tags, bookmarks. Soon also if you shared/liked or cited it on social media.
- **Cite with precision**  
   Instead of copy-pasting a quote from the article and the url, highlight any piece of text and create a link you can share with anybody. Anyone opening the link will be brought straight to the text you are referring to.
- **Flexibly Organise**  
   Tag, bookmark and organise websites into lists.
- **User Privacy**  
   Approach allows us to leave user in full control of your data. By default, all is stored on your computer
